# React Example with State Machine

This is an example project demonstrating how to use the
[**state-machine-react**](https://github.com/state-management/state-machine-react). 
library with React. The project showcases:

- Subscribing to state changes using the `fromState` hook.
- Dispatching commands using the `useDispatcher` hook.
- Unit testing React components with `setupMockStateMachine`.

The **state-machine-react** is a React-specific wrapper for the core library, [simple-state-machine](https://github.com/state-management/simple-state-machine).
